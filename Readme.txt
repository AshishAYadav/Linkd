This readme file provides the complete detail for the S121 url shortener.
S121 is url shortener originally built using PHP. The concept being used here is the file system rather than databases to keep things simpler.

This project can not be used for large scale url shortening because files and folders increases tremendously and hence database concept is required for modification and more features and management.
This can work for small scale projects and much functionalities further can be added to it.

Entering a valid URL with or without http/https works well. If entered then fine else automatically gets appended. Enter a keyword at least of length 3. Generated url will be s.ml/keyword .
This is a 302 temporary redirect to your URL. If keyword not available please try combining UPPER and lower case letters as it is case sensitive or try another keyword.
Till now what is the total number of urls shortened are displayed at the footer of the site.
